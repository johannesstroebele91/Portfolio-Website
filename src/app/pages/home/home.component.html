                 alt="Header design for the Sketch Meetup Stuttgart">
            <p>I had the pleasure of working with Johannes at START Munich,
                a startup student club at the TU Munich. He has optimized the web appearance,
                build up the online marketing, and organized several successful events.
                Johannes impressed me with his great motivation and project management skills

            <h3>Faruk Toy</h3>

                 src="../../../assets/recommender-faruktoy.png"
                 alt="Header design for the Sketch Meetup Stuttgart">
            <p>Johannes is very talented and skilled. He has great ideas and he is able to make them work.
                He is very dependable and it was a pleasure to work with him.
                Johannes has certainly great entrepreneurial spirit.</p>

            <h3>Tim Stefany</h3>
            <h4>Cloud Mobility Working Student</h4>
            <img routerLink="https://www.celonis.com/" class="img-recommendation my-3"
                 src="../../../assets/recommender-timstefany.png"
                 alt="Header design for the Sketch Meetup Stuttgart">
            <p>Having Johannes as a full stack developer in our data science project was great!
                Whether it was the deployment of our dashboard via Google Cloud,
                issues with the Python Flask backend, setting up the frontend,
                or our PostgreSQL database, Johannes was always up to the task.
                In my opinion, Johannes's skill set as a developer and project manager makes
                him a versatile employee and a great asset to any team.</p>
