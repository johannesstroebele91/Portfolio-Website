    <!-- 2. General information -->
    <h2 id="general">2. General information</h2>
    <p>Personal data (usually referred to just as "data" below) will only be processed by us to the extent necessary and
        for the purpose of providing a functional and user-friendly website, including its contents, and the services
        offered there.</p>
    <p>Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred
        to as the "GDPR"), "processing" refers to any operation or set of operations such as collection, recording,
        organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by
        transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available, alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or
        destruction performed on personal data, whether by automated means or not.</p>
    <p>The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the type, scope, purpose, duration,
        and legal basis for the processing of such data either under our own control or in conjunction with others. We
        also inform you below about the third-party components we use to optimise our website and improve the user
        experience which may result in said third parties also processing data they collect and control.</p>


    <!-- 3. The rights of users and data subjects -->
    <h2 id="datarights">3. The rights of users and data subjects</h2>
    <p>With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data subjects have the
        right</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="ulbullets">to confirmation of whether data concerning them are being processed, information about the
            data being processed, further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data
            (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);
        </li>
        <li class="ulbullets">to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);</li>
        <li class="ulbullets">to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or,
            alternatively, if further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said
            processing per Art. 18 GDPR;
        </li>
        <li class="ulbullets">to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same
            transmitted to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);
        </li>
        <li class="ulbullets">to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning
            them are being processed by the controller in breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such
        corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However,
        this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort.
        Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these recipients.</p>
    <p><strong>Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users, and data subjects have the right to object to the controller's
        future processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data
        processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.</strong></p>
